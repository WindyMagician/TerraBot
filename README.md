Terreria ML Write Up

The goal of this project is to produce an AI agent trained using reinforcement learning that is capable of beating the first boss in Terraria. The algorithm will be written with a reward system that enforces certain steps in a Terraria playthrough. This will produce an AI that is capable of surviving, moving, obtaining upgrades, and obtaining tools capable of defeating the Eye of Cthulhu.

Progress Tracking:
 Screen Capture and Input [X]
Simple movement from AI. []
Breaking blocks. []
Reward System. []
Ground Detection. []
Reinforcement of reward system. []
Accelerating game run time and AI training. []
Observation and continued updates. []
Error fixing. []
Niche Action Pathing (Spawners, potions, reforging?) []
 Arena Assembly. []
Training against the eye. []
Increased Testing. []
Full Run Attempts []

The bot used to complete these attempts will be named KidBot#, each iteration of him shall be for a new form of testing. Consider the following to be a graveyard with the latest bot being the newest living of them.

KidBot1-2: Miscreated bots.
KidBot3: Journey Mode Bot for simple movement from Python and screen capture testing.


The following are the most simple and needed items for an AI to be able to beat the Eye of Cthulhu. This should be seen as a no more situation. These are the minimal items a player has to have to beat this boss, and what I would consider the least needed for a successful defeat in normal mode.

4-6 Heart Crystals
Armor preferable, full tier 2 metal or cactus should be sufficient.
Hermes Boots/Variant Boots
Cloud in a bottle/Variant bottle items
A (good) chest weapon.
Bonuses (Shackle, Band of regen
